## ðŸ‘‹ About Me

With over a decade of experience in product and program management, I've led cross-functional teams in developing everything from healthcare workflow solutions to IoT business applications. My journey spans from hands-on technical roles to strategic product leadership, always with a focus on creating user-centric solutions.

**My expertise includes:**

My educational background includes a Master's from The Centre for Digital Media, where I was awarded the Dianne Sinclair Memorial Fellowship for outstanding achievement.
