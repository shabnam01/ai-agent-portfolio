## ðŸ‘‹ About Me
Hi, I'm **Shabnam Suresh Babu** â€“ a strategic Product & Program Manager with 12+ years of experience building innovative solutions that bridge technology and user needs. Currently working with the AI Community Learning Program powered by Microsoft Teams, I'm passionate about leveraging AI to solve real-world problems and streamline complex workflows.

With over a decade of experience in product and program management, I've led cross-functional teams in developing everything from healthcare workflow solutions to IoT business applications. My journey spans from hands-on technical roles to strategic product leadership, always with a focus on creating user-centric solutions.

**My expertise includes:**
- **AI-powered product development**
- **End-to-end product lifecycle management**
- **User experience design and optimization**
- **Agile and project management methodologies**
- **Cross-functional team leadership**

I hold certifications in Project Management (PMP), Advanced Scrum Product Owner (A-CSPO), and have completed specialized training in Generative AI for Project Managers. My educational background includes a Master's from The Centre for Digital Media, where I was awarded the Dianne Sinclair Memorial Fellowship for outstanding achievement.

When I'm not building AI agents, you'll find me mentoring through organizations like Ladies Learning Code, contributing to the AI community, and staying at the forefront of emerging technologies.
